# AppLite - Just some simple JavaScript helpers. 
The point of this is to just provide some basic, lightweight functionality that
is a little cleaner than pure vanilla JS and a lot smaller/simpler than jQuery. 

# Why? 
Really the point here is to expose the vanilla JS alternatives to jQuery. 
Trying to figure out how stuff works using the uncompressed jQuery source is
frustrating because it's a pretty big and complex script. This app aims to be
just as useful for a lot of basic tasks but organized in logical ES6 modules
with easy-to-understand code and detailed documentation. 

# There's More
I'm also planning to integrate templating, which is outside of the scope of jQuery. 
I will likely use mustache.js for logic-less templating since it's a reasonably-sized
library and there's no point in reinventing the wheel for 1 specific task but I will
include non-engine templating using the <template> tag and node cloning.
